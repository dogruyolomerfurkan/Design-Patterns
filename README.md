# Strategy Design Pattern

  Defines a <em><b>family of algorithms</b></em>, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

# Observer Design Pattern

  Defines a <em><b>one-to-many dependency</b></em> between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
